# Computer Agent Improvement Plan

This document tracks planned improvements for the code in the `/src` directory.

## 1. Dependency Management
- [x] Add version constraints to `requirements.txt` for better reproducibility
- [ ] Consider adding a dependency for a database like SQLite for storing user preferences and conversation history
- [ ] Consider replacing Redis with Valkey in case Redis functionality is needed in the future

## 2. Code Structure and Organization
- [x] Implement proper error handling throughout the codebase with custom exceptions
- [x] Add type hints to all functions for better code quality and IDE support
- [x] Create a config module to centralize configuration parameters
- [x] Consider implementing logging using a dedicated logging module
- [x] Separate UI and business logic more clearly

## 3. Specific Improvements by File

### window.py
- [ ] Refactor the large MainWindow class into smaller components
- [ ] Implement a proper MVC or MVVM pattern
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts configuration options
- [ ] Improve dark/light mode theme switching with proper theme management

### anthropic.py
- [ ] Add proper API key management with secure storage
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for API errors
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls
- [ ] Consider implementing LRU cache for similar requests

### computer.py
- [ ] Add safety mechanisms to prevent dangerous actions
- [ ] Implement more robust error handling for screen actions
- [ ] Add a "safe mode" with limited capabilities
- [ ] Improve screenshot handling with better memory management

### voice_control.py
- [ ] Implement offline fallback for voice recognition
- [ ] Add user-configurable wake words
- [ ] Improve voice control reliability with better signal processing
- [ ] Add more voice feedback options

### store.py
- [ ] Implement proper state management with a state machine pattern
- [ ] Add data persistence for run history
- [ ] Improve error logging and recovery
- [ ] Implement better message formatting for display

### prompt_manager.py
- [ ] Create a template system for different types of prompts
- [ ] Add version control for prompts
- [ ] Implement prompt validation
- [ ] Add categorization for different task types

## 4. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for UI components
- [x] Add proper docstrings and comments
- [x] Create user documentation

## 5. Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize screenshot capture and processing
- [ ] Implement background processing for non-UI tasks
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large histories

## 6. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement proper credential management
- [ ] Add permissions management for system actions
- [ ] Secure local storage of sensitive data
- [ ] Add activity logging for security purposes

## 7. User Experience
- [ ] Improve the UI with more modern components
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Implement proper error messages for users
- [ ] Add a tutorial system for new users
